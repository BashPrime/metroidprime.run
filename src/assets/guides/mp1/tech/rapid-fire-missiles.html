<h1 class="title">Rapid Fire Missiles</h1>
<div class="content">
    <p>Missiles normally have a slow rate of fire, but by closing the Missile Launcher just after firing a missile, you can
        fire another one almost immediately and skip the large cooldown.</p>
    <p>Rapid fire missiles are useful for dealing large amounts of damage quickly, such as to quick kill some bosses like the
        Parasite Queen and Sheegoth.</p>
    <h2>How-To</h2>
    <p>Make sure the Power Beam is active. With your right hand in a "claw" grip on the controller, hold up on the C Stick,
        then repeatedly tap Y to rapid fire missiles.</p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The A button can also be used to close the Missile Launcher. It's a slower method, but it's useful if you're only
            firing a couple of missiles and don't want to change your controller grip.</li>
    </ul>
