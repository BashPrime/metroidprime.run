    <p>L jumping is the most basic form of movement in a Metroid Prime speedrun. L jumping lets you move faster than walking,
        and lets you jump farther than jumping normally.</p>
    <h2>How-To</h2>
    <p>When you begin a jump (including your Space Jump if you have the Space Jump Boots equipped), hold the L button for 13
        frames (just under a quarter of a second), then let go of L.</p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>During a normal jump, you decelerate for 13 frames before accelerating. Holding L will prevent you from decelerating,
            so you will be moving faster by the time you start accelerating. As a result, you jump farther/move faster than
            a normal jump or walking.</li>
        <li>You can go even faster by turning sideways during your jump.</li>
    </ul>
