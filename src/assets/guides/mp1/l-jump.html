<div class="content">
    <p>L jumping is one of the simplest techniques in the game; it's just a standard jump with a button press. It's a very useful
        technique as it nets you more distance than jumping without using the L button.</p>
    <h2>How-To</h2>
    <p>When you begin a jump (including your second jump), hold the L button for just under a quarter of a second (13 frames),
        then let go of L.</p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Holding down L resets your momentum gained during an L jump, but it can be very effective to control where you want
            to land on a platform.</li>
    </ul>
