<h1 class="title">Dash Jump</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">Discovered by: Varsis Erion, TreborSelbon</h2>
<div class="content">
    <p>Dash jumping (also called dashing) allows you to leap sideways at high speeds and great distances. It is one of the fastest
        forms of movement in the game, and allows you to reach areas you otherwise could not with regular jumps, making it
        a valuable sequence breaking tool.</p>
    <h2>How-To</h2>
    <p>Lock onto an enemy or object in front of you by holding down the L button (all the way, until it clicks). Once locked
        on, begin a strafe dash by holding left or right on the joystick, then quickly tapping the B button while still holding
        L. After about a tenth of a second (7 frames for an optimal dash jump), release both the L button and the joystick.</p>
    <h2>Bending a Dash Jump</h2>
    <p>There are some scenarios where dashing to the left or the right in a straight line just won't work, such as if there
        is a platform in front of or behind you that you need to reach. Thankfully, you can get around this issue by using
        the joystick to curve your trajectory. While airborne, you can "bend" the dash by holding the joystick up to bend
        forwards, or down to bend backwards. For an even tighter curve, hold the joystick in the opposite direction of your
        jump, at one of the diagonal notches.</p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Scan dashes can only be done in the North American 0-00 and 0-01 versions of the game, but you can dash jump with
            the other three visors on every version released.</li>
        <li>The reason a dash jump works is because there is no cap on your lateral (sideways) speed. If you turn during the
            jump so that you're moving forwards or backwards, you will slow down and jump a shorter distance, usually resulting
            in you coming up short when jumping to a platform or ledge.</li>
