<h1 class="title">Ghetto Jump</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle is-6">Discovered by: Paratroopa</h2>
<div class="content">
    <p>Ghetto jumping (also called slope jumping) gives you extra height when you jump against a sloped surface. Ghetto jumping
        underwater without the Gravity Suit gives you considerably more height than on land.</p>
    <h2>How-To</h2>
    <p>Find a sloped surface (even the back of a Stone Toad works), and perform an L jump directly into the slope; just after
        your jump begins, either let go of the joystick or hold away from the slope to avoid rubbing against it and losing
        your jump height.</p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If you obtain the Gravity Suit, your ghetto jumps will revert to getting as much height as on land.</li>
    </ul>
