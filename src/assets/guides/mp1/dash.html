    <p>Dashing allows you to leap sideways at high speeds and great distances. It is one of the fastest forms of movement in
        the game, and allows you to reach areas earlier than intended.</p>
    <h2>How-To</h2>
    <p>Lock onto an enemy or object in front of you by holding down the L button (all the way, until it clicks). Begin the dash
        by moving sideways, then quickly tapping the B button while still holding L. After about a tenth of a second (7 frames
        for an optimal dash), release both the L button and the joystick.</p>
    <h2>Bending a Dash</h2>
    <p>Sometimes, dashing to the left or the right in a straight line just won't work, such as if there is a platform in front
        of or behind you that you need to reach. Thankfully, you can work around this by using the joystick to curve your
        trajectory. While airborne, you can "bend" the dash by holding the joystick up or down to move forwards or backwards
        during the dash. For an even tighter curve, hold the joystick in the opposite direction of your jump, at one of the
        diagonal notches.</p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Once you are airborne, never hold the direction you're flying in. By doing so you're making Samus face forwards,
            which applies a speed cap and slows you down.</li>
        <li>Scan dashes can only be done in the North American 0-00 and 0-01 versions of the game, but you can dash with the
            other three visors in any version of Metroid Prime.</li>
        <li>Some dashes are more situational and work best if you wait a little bit longer to let go of L, such as scan dashing
            off of the Sap Sac in Tallon Canyon and a Stone Toad in Watery Hall.</li>
    </ul>
