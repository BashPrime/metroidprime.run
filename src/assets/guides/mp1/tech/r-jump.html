<h1 class="title">R Jump</h1>
<div class="content">
    <p>R jumps are a faster form of jumping that nets greater distance than L jumping, at the expense of losing most control
        over your trajectory. The Space Jump Boots are needed in order to R jump.</p>
    <h2>How-To</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>L jump off of the ground (making sure to let go of the L button), then press R while you're airborne. The R button
            can be pressed at any time while in the air, but only before your Space Jump.</li>
        <li>Now that R has been pressed, your speed will be locked the next time you press L. Press and hold L immediately before your Space Jump,
            then release the L button.</li>
        <li>You'll want to turn sideways during the R jump to maximize your speed. For an optimal turn, hold the joystick somewhere
            between the up-right and right notch (up-left/left if you're turning left), then holding straight up on the stick
            when you are fully sideways.</li>
    </ol>
