    <p>The L-Lock Spring Space Jump is a meme, not an actual trick.</p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Im not like this. These need are seperate category. Thats unfair runner like Zoid who is did most awesome speedruns
            in SDA without secret worlds. He is just best, thats so unfair if he got lost his records if someone used secret
            worlds. Also secret worlds are cheating. These skip large amount game and you will always find new secret wolrds
            and route will always changed. Also wall crawls skip much interesting tricks and its not look cool see when someone
            jumping outsite screen most of the time. All super awesome trick will lost like vent shaft bomb jump, geo core
            bombslot jump and etc... stuff. If we talking about low-% runs. I personally like watch much more speedruns without
            used secret worlds because these speedruns are real. So this rule change is big bad idea. Im not like this. Hopefully
            its never happen.</li>
